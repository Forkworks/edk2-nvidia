## @file
#  Platform password library instance that returns the password clear state based upon PCD.
#
#  PlatformPasswordLib instance does NOT really detect whether the password is cleared
#  but returns the PCD value directly. This instance can be used to verify security
#  related features during platform enabling and development. It should be replaced
#  by a platform-specific method(e.g. Button pressed) in a real platform for product.
